## We are growing ðŸŒ± ðŸŒ¿ ðŸŒ³

Astrolicious is growing daily! We have gathered over 100 members on our [Discord](https://chat.astrolicious.dev) server and we are excited to see the enthusiasm inside our community. People are sharing their ideas, asking questions and helping each other with their own blog posts, tutorials or examples.

Additionally, in our continued our efforts to get more community members involved with decision making, we are proud to announce that [Fryuni (Luiz Ferraz)](https://github.com/fryuni), has joined the team to help shape our future.

## Sunsetting Maintenance Efforts ðŸŒ‡

Despite the momentum, we have struggled with our dream to offer shared maintenance to our projects. We can't commit to providing the necessary maintenance for projects to succeed and grow.

We have made a tough decision. We are sunsetting our shared code maintenance efforts with immediate effect. That means there are not any Astrolicious maintained code project anymore. But our current [projects](/projects) will stay part of Astrolicious and will continue to be maintained by their original authors and engaged community members.

## Our new focus

Astrolicious is doubling down on **content creation and community building**.

We will offer a Hub to connect the ecosystem, bringing together project authors, Astro users, and content creators. We will continue to create content for Astro Tips, offer a _validated_ [projects list](/projects), help content creators to get discovered, and explore new ways to provide valuable content to our own and Astro community.

## Building in Public ðŸ“¢

We have decided to share as much as possible about our journey publicly. This starts with our [public roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/astrolicious/projects/1) and public [organisational meetings](https://discord.com/events/1217527207467946087/1285303597181177958).

We are not stopping there! We will continue to share our learnings, insights and decisions transparently on this [blog](/blog). Additionally we are planning to have weekly content creation events on our Discord, to engage with our community.

We are excited to see what the future holds for Astrolicious, hoping y'all join us on this adventure.

We are always looking to get feedback, so feel free to reach out to us on [Discord](https://chat.astrolicious.dev) or [X/Twitter](https://twitter.com/astroliciousdev).
